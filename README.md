# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption

The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption project is a simple cybersecurity project that implements the Caesar cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt messages. This project provides a user-friendly interface for users to input messages and choose a shift value for encryption or decryption.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Algorithm:** Implements the classic Caesar cipher algorithm for shifting characters in messages.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** Allows users to encrypt plaintext messages by shifting characters and decrypt ciphertext messages by reversing the shift.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for inputting messages and selecting shift values.
- **Instant Feedback:** The application instantly displays the encrypted or decrypted message based on user input.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python (and any required libraries) installed.
3. Run the `caesar_cipher.py` script.
4. Enter a message to encrypt or decrypt.
5. Select a shift value and choose to encrypt or decrypt.
6. Observe the result of the encryption or decryption.
